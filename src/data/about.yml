mission: |
  We are a group of TJ students interested in the independent
  production of masks and other materials that are in very short
  supply during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our purpose is to organize
  households across the DMV into a production center for masks and
  other materials to ship to sites around the US in dire need of them.
  Epicenters of the outbreak, including New York City, Seattle, and
  Chicago, are being contacted to gauge what materials are in need.
