mission: |
    We are a group of students working to connect hospitals in the DC-Maryland-Virginia region with desperately needed supplies, 
    in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our team is also working on independently producing hospital-approved Personal 
    Protective Equipment (PPE) and other items, with the eventual vision of organizing households across the DMV into a production 
    center to support healthcare workers during this time of crisis and shortage.
